## World Weather Analysis

This purpose of this repository is to add weather descriptions to the established weather data from the module, along with input statements that will allow users to filter the data for specific weather preferences. These preferences will then identify possible travel destinations and hotels close to those locations. From there, users can choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Then, Google Maps Directions API will help build a travel route and a marker map for the itinerary created by the user.
